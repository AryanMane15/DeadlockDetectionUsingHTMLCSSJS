        <strong>Deadlock detection</strong> is a technique used in operating
        systems and concurrent systems to identify a deadlock, a situation where
        a set of processes are blocked because each process holds a resource and
        waits for another resource held by another process. In this scenario,
        none of the processes can proceed, leading to a system halt. Deadlock
        detection involves monitoring resource allocation and process requests
        to spot such conditions. The system may use a directed graph called a
        Wait-for Graph (WFG) to represent the relationships between processes
        and resources. If a cycle is detected in the WFG, a deadlock exists.
        Once detected, the system may recover by terminating one or more
        processes or preempting resources. Deadlock detection is necessary in
        systems where avoidance or prevention is impractical, and it usually
        comes with a performance cost due to continuous monitoring. <br />

        <b>Advantages:</b>
        <li>Efficient resource utilization without strict protocols.</li>
        <li>Allows dynamic resource requests, offering system flexibility.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <b>Disadvantages:</b>
        <li>High computational overhead for detection.</li>
        <li>
          Recovery from deadlocks can be complex and may lead to process
          termination or data loss.
